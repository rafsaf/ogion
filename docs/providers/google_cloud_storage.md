# Google Cloud Storage

## Environment variable

```bash
BACKUP_PROVIDER="name=gcs bucket_name=my_bucket_name bucket_upload_path=my_ogion_instance_1 service_account_base64=Z29vZ2xlX3NlcnZpY2VfYWNjb3VudAo="
```

Uses Google Cloud Storage bucket for storing backups.

!!! note
    _There can be only one upload provider defined per app, using **BACKUP_PROVIDER** environemnt variable_. It's type is guessed by using `name`, in this case `name=gcs`. Params must be included in value, splited by single space for example "value1=1 value2=foo".

## Resources

#### Creating bucket

[https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets)

#### Creating service account

[https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create)

#### Giving it required roles to service account

1. Go "IAM and admin" -> "IAM"

2. Find your service account and update its roles

Give it following roles so it will have **read access for whole bucket "my_bucket_name"** and **admin access for only path prefix "my_ogion_instance_1" in bucket "my_bucket_name"**:

1. **Storage Object Admin** (with IAM condition: NAME starts with `projects/_/buckets/my_bucket_name/objects/my_ogion_instance_1`)
2. **Storage Object Viewer** (with IAM condition: NAME starts with `projects/_/buckets/my_bucket_name`)

!!! tip "Reduced Permissions with BACKUP_DELETE=false"
    If you set `BACKUP_DELETE=false` in your configuration, Ogion will only upload backups without performing cleanup operations. In this case, you can use reduced permissions - only **Storage Object Creator** role is needed (no delete or list permissions required). This is useful when using GCS bucket lifecycle rules to manage backup expiration instead of Ogion's built-in cleanup.

After sucessfully creating service account, create new private key with JSON type and download it. File similar to `your_project_name-03189413be28.json` will appear in your Downloads.

To get base64 (without any new lines) from it, use command:

```bash
cat your_project_name-03189413be28.json | base64 -w 0
```

#### Terraform

If using terraform for managing cloud infra, Service Accounts definition can be following:

```bash
resource "google_service_account" "ogion-my_ogion_instance_1" {
  account_id   = "ogion-my_ogion_instance_1"
  display_name = "SA my_ogion_instance_1 for ogion bucket access"
}

resource "google_project_iam_member" "ogion-my_ogion_instance_1-iam-object-admin" {
  project = local.project_id
  role    = "roles/storage.objectAdmin"
  member  = "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.ogion-my_ogion_instance_1.email}"
  condition {
    title      = "object_admin_only_ogion_bucket_specific_path"
    expression = "resource.name.startsWith(\"projects/_/buckets/my_bucket_name/objects/my_ogion_instance_1\")"
  }
}
resource "google_project_iam_member" "ogion-my_ogion_instance_1-iam-object-viewer" {
  project = local.project_id
  role    = "roles/storage.objectViewer"
  member  = "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.ogion-my_ogion_instance_1.email}"

  condition {
    title      = "object_viewer_only_ogion_bucket"
    expression = "resource.name.startsWith(\"projects/_/buckets/my_bucket_name\")"
  }
}

```
