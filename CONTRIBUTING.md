# How to contribute

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, ask for help! You can
submit a work in progress (WIP) pull request, or file an issue with the parts
you know. We'll do our best to guide you in the right direction, and let you
know if there are guidelines we will need to follow. We want people to be able
to participate without fear of doing the wrong thing.

Below are our expectations for contributors. Following these guidelines gives us
the best opportunity to work with you, by making sure we have the things we need
in order to make it happen. Doing your best to follow it will speed up our
ability to merge PRs and respond to issues.

Both upload providers and backup targets were created with possibility to easly add new in the future.

## Project requirements

- Python 3.13.
- Uv [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
- Docker and docker compose plugin [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Debian/Ubuntu are known to work.
- To work with databases natively, `postgresql-client` and `mariadb-client` packages installed on your system, there are scripts in `scripts` that can help.

## Setup steps

1. Install python dependencies

   `uv sync`

2. Install pre-commit hooks.

   `pre-commit install`

3. Create `.env` file

   `cp .env.example .env`

4. To run database backups, you will need `mariadb-client` and `postgresql-client` installed, there are dedicated scripts in folder `/scripts` that can do that (or install using `apt` for example).

5. Setup databases

   `make docker_setup_up`

   Note, file `docker/docker-compose.dbs.yml` is automatically updated weekly keeping always latest tag per release cycle and adding new releases and removing those after EOL.

6. You can run ogion (`--single` here to make all backups immediatly and then exit):

   `python -m ogion.main --single`

## Docs

To play with documentation, after dependencies are in place installed with uv:

`mkdocs serve` will start development server.

## Testing

The project has a handful of test cases which must pass for a contribution to be
accepted. We also expect that you either create new test cases or modify
existing ones in order to target your changes.

You can run all the test cases locally by invoking `pytest`.

Since the code is closely related to docker container environment, setup to run pytest
directly in the container exists:

- amd64: `make unit_tests`
- arm64 (slow, qemu) `OGION_ARCH=arm64 make unit_tests`

To run tests vs `arm64` you will need to follow steps in https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/.

Note, exactly above is being run inside runners in tests github action.

## Acceptance tests

The tests folder includes tests for cloud providers integrations, including fake gcs server, minio instance and azurite, but for obvious reasons this is only 99% replacement for full end-to-end tests with **real** credentials to storage in cloud and eventually costs involved, proceed with caution!

For `Debug` provider acceptance tests, existing `.env.example` can be ok for `.env` file. To test other providers, you will need to change `BACKUP_PROVIDER` environment variable accordingly.

Then `make acceptance_tests_amd64` (or even for arm64 `make acceptance_tests_arm64`) will build docker image target `build` and your local `.env` file, then fire single backup to upload provider and exit.

## Coding conventions

We expect that all code contributions have been formatted using `ruff format`. You can
run `ruff format .` to format your code.

The project use `ruff` for style, isort rules etc. This is also included in `pre-commit` rules, but you can use `ruff check . --fix`

We also expect passing `mypy` static code analysis, that can be run with `mypy .`

## Commit message conventions

There is no dedicated commit message convention, just use descriptive commit messages and useful branch/PR names.

## Releasing

On every push to `main` branch, there is automated build that will create `dev` image tag. Then usually after at minimum 1-2 days after it is propagated to some real world ogion instances and working just fine, release is made manually using GitHub releases with autogenerated changelog. After new release and tag is created, for example `4.0`, docker image with the same tag is build and uploaded to dockerhub.

See https://github.com/rafsaf/ogion/releases.

## Docs releasing

Mike is used for docs versioning: https://github.com/jimporter/mike

After new release is triggered, manual command needs to be run (eg. tag `0.1`) and then generated commit pushed to origin:

```
mike deploy --push --update-aliases 0.1 latest
mike set-default --push 0.1
```

That is usually done simultaneously with release process.
